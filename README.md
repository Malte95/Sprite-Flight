## ▶️ Play in Browser (WebGL)
👉 If you publish a WebGL build, add the link here:  
https://malte95.github.io/Asteroid-Fields/

> Recruiters can play the game directly in the browser – no setup required.

## 🎮 Features
- 🚀 Player spaceship movement and controls
- 💥 Randomly spawning asteroids
- 📈 Score system tracking survival time
- 🎵 Sound effects and simple UI
- 🛠️ Basic 3D physics interactions

*(Adjust this list to exactly match your implementation.)*

## 🧠 What I learned
This project builds on fundamentals similar to Unity’s official beginner 2D game course, where you learn to:

- Set up and navigate Unity projects and scenes  
- Use physics and colliders to make GameObjects interactive  
- Write C# scripts to control movement and gameplay  
- Handle user input for controlling the player  
- Create obstacle behaviors and randomness  
- Build a scoring system and restart logic  
- Implement basic UI elements for score and status

These skills are core techniques taught in Unity’s *2D Beginner Game: Sprite Flight* tutorial, which guides through building a full game from scratch (player control, obstacles, scoring, UI, and publishing). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
